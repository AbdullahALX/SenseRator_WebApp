# SenseRator 2.0

SenseRator is a multi-platform application that provides real-time cellular and web performance data. The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: A React-based application that provides the user interface.
- **Backend**: A Node.js-based server that handles API requests and data processing.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

### Frontend

The `frontend` directory contains the React application responsible for the user interface and visualization.

### Backend

The `backend` directory contains the Node.js server responsible for API endpoints, data processing, and interaction with the database.
